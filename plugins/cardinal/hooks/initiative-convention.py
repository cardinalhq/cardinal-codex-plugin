"""cardinal initiative convention — SessionStart hook.

Tells the agent the branch-naming convention Cardinal uses to attribute
agent spend to initiatives. Every session in a git repo sees this
prompt so that when the agent cuts a new branch during the conversation,
the branch name produces a clean (initiative_name, initiative_type)
classification in the Outcomes Dashboard.

Contract:
  - Input on stdin: Codex's SessionStart hook JSON payload
    {session_id, cwd, hook_event_name, source, ...} (Claude-compatible
    field names — codex-port.md §2).
  - Output: JSON on stdout with hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext
    when cwd is inside a git repo. Otherwise exits silently with no
    output (there's no branch to advise on).
  - Best-effort: any failure exits 0 silently. Never blocks session
    start.

Why a hook (not just README): the agent only sees what's in its context.
A README in the plugin repo doesn't reach the session running in a
different repo. SessionStart additionalContext is the surface the host
provides for "tell the model this on every session" — short,
authoritative, in-context.
