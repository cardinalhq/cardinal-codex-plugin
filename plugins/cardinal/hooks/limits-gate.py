"""cardinal limits gate — UserPromptSubmit (SYNC).

Reads the spend-limit verdict that git-state.py's async fetch cached at
~/.codex/cardinal/limits/<session>.verdict.json and turns it into hook
output. This hook NEVER touches the network — it is on the turn-critical
path, so its budget is one small file read. The verdict it acts on is at
most one turn + the server TTL stale, which the 75/90% threshold margins
absorb (conductor docs/specs/agent-spend-limits.md §Delivery).

Severity → channel mapping (the server decides severity; we route it):

  decision=allow, band>0 (notify) → additionalContext only — the model
                                    quietly economizes, no user noise.
  decision=warn                   → additionalContext + systemMessage —
                                    recommendations like /clear or "split
                                    this PR" are HUMAN actions; the
                                    engineer must see them directly.
  decision=block                  → {"decision": "block", reason} — the
                                    turn is stopped; the reason names the
                                    setter and the override path.

Anti-nag hysteresis: warn/notify surface only when the threshold band
RISES (75 → 90 → 100); the last surfaced band lives in <session>.ack.json
(owned by this hook — single-writer, no races with the fetch side). A
block is enforced every turn while in force.

Fail open, always: missing/corrupt/stale verdict → exit 0 with no output.
